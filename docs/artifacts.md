# Artifact Caching

Monofo provides a locally cached artifact download/upload utility. This
functionality is accessed by using monofo as a Buildkite plugin from your steps.

This functionality is particularly optimized for producing and using compressed
tarballs to collect and cache very large numbers of files
(e.g. `node-modules.tar.lz4`). If you only need to upload/download a few files,
you might find it easier to use the standard
[artifacts plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/artifacts-buildkite-plugin).

## Uploads

The `upload` subcommand takes a target artifact output file name, like
`node-modules.tar.lz4`. The artifact filename will determine what sort of
compressed archive is produced.

The `upload` subcommand also needs a list of files to include in the archive.
This list can be passed using:
 - a list of glob expressions, or
 - a file containing a list of paths to include

The glob expressions and paths must be relative, and point to locations below
the working directory. Intermediate directories between the working directory
and the target paths will be included in the archive as (otherwise empty) 
placeholder structure.

Passing `-` as the file to read from will cause `upload` to read the list of
files from `stdin` - this allows e.g. using `find -print0` to produce a list
of matching files to upload.

```yaml
steps:
  - commands:
      - yarn install
      - yarn build
    plugins:
      - vital-software/monofo#v3.7.1:
          upload:
            node-modules.tar.lz4:
              filesFrom: node-modules.list
              null:      true
            build.caidx:
              - "dist/**"
              - "another/dist/**"
```


Passing a "filesFrom" list can be much faster than using globs, because it
allows the use of `-prune` (to early-exit from a `find` traversal, skipping a
lot of file I/O). This is particularly useful for finding large numbers of small
files by pointing at their parent directories e.g. `node_modules/`)

## Downloads

The `download` subcommand accepts a list of artifacts to download. If these
artifacts end with a supported tarball suffix (see compression section below),
they'll be automatically inflated and extracted in-place. The download and
extract happens in a `pre-command`, so by the time the `command` runs, the
necessary files will be in place.

```yaml
steps:
  - commands:
      - yarn run some-command
    plugins:
      - vital-software/monofo#v3.7.1:
          download:
            - node-modules.tar.lz4
            - build.caidx
```

## Compression

Compression is automatically applied during the `upload`, based on the target
filename for the tarball, and then transparently removed during the `download`.
The supported compression types are:

- `.tar`: uses no compression
- `.tar.gz`: uses `gzip` to compress the tar
- `.tar.lz4`: uses `lz4` to compress the tar
- `.caidx`: uses `desync` to store the tar in a content-addressed store,
  replacing the tarball with an "index file"

### Desync

Monofo uses [desync](https://github.com/folbricht/desync) to provide content-addressed
caching and storage, speeding up the upload and download of artifacts and cached
files.

#### Installing desync

In order for Monofo to use desync, it must be available on the `PATH`. You can
build a `desync` binary for your platform using `go install`:

```shell
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go install github.com/folbricht/desync/cmd/desync@latest
```

#### Configuring desync

There are two main configuration environment variables:

- `MONOFO_DESYNC_STORE`: Usually, an S3 bucket, used to store content-addressed
   chunks
- `MONOFO_DESYNC_CACHE`: Usually, a local directory, used as a look-through
   cache when they'd otherwise be downloaded from S3

These environment variables are substituted into the eventual desync command as
the `--store` and `--cache` options. For example, Monofo itself uses:

```typescript
MONOFO_DESYNC_STORE: "s3+https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/some-s3-bucket-name/desync/store"
MONOFO_DESYNC_CACHE: "/tmp/desync/monofo"
```

The `s3+https://` scheme is explained at [folbricht/desync](https://github.com/folbricht/desync#s3-chunk-stores)
