`monofo download`
=================

Downloads the given list of artifacts, inflating them if they are suitable archives

Receives a list of references to files

We support a few special cases:
  - if .tar.gz, we inflate the artifact using gzip, and extract in-place
  - if .tar.lz4, we inflate the artifact using lz4, and extract in-place
  - if .catar.caibx, we inflate the artifact from desync, and extract in-place

In all cases, we don't support a "from/to" style configuration, only a list of artifacts - this is because they are all
expected to be inflated in the working directory. For each artifact, we support three modifiers passed in env vars:

  - MONOFO_ARTIFACT_<NAME>_SOFT_FAIL=0|1 - allows failures to download this artifact
  - MONOFO_ARTIFACT_<NAME>_SKIP=0|1 - allows skipping an artifact dynamically
  - MONOFO_ARTIFACT_<NAME>_BUILD_ID=<build UUID> - allows selecting a specific build to pull the artifact from
