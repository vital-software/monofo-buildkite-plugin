# Usage: create a pipeline that looks like this:
#
# steps:
#   - name: ":pipeline: Generate pipeline"
#     plugins:
#       - seek-oss/aws-sm#v2.2.1: # for example, but your secret management might be e.g. via S3 bucket or "env" file instead
#           env:
#             BUILDKITE_API_ACCESS_TOKEN: "global/buildkite-api-access-token"
#       - vital-software/monofo#<latest>:
#           generate: pipeline
#
# If you had a previous generator, you need to wait until all branches have the
# script before calling it, or change the command to:
#
# git merge-base --is-ancestor <merge-commit-of-generate-pipeline> HEAD && .buildkite/generate-pipeline || ( <previous-command> )
#
# This script installs and calls monofo with a static version so the install is
# cached and fast
